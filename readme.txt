== Description ==

Automatically turn all posts into excerpts of 300 characters or less and add a "Show More" link that will load directly in the page. If your post includes a picture, it will also obtain a thumbnail and place that at the beginning of the excerpt. Supports Infinite Scroll, too (assuming you manually enabled it on your P2 site)!

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
